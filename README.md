# SDAIA_ML_Bootcamp_Assiments
## This repository contains the assignments I completed during SDAIA Machine Learning Bootcamp. 
Throughout the bootcamp, I worked with various machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and linear regression. I also focused on data preprocessing, which involved data cleaning, normalization, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, detecting outliers, and addressing data imbalance to ensure high-quality inputs for model training.

In each assignment, I applied these skills to real datasets, building models and deploying them to address specific business and social challenges.
